Description: HitchTest
        =========
        
        HitchTest is a part of the hitch testing framework which compiles
        YAML and jinja2 to python unittest.
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        * Individual test cases should be declarative.
        * The engine that runs them should be imperative.
        
        YAML provides an easy way to provide a *less* powerful language to
        write test scenarios in that can be easily compiled to a more powerful
        language (python). This makes reading, writing, parsing and adding
        features to test cases much easier.
        
        Theoretically, the YAML should be readable and writable by non-programmers.
